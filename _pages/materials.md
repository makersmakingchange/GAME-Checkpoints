  We created a spreadsheet that lists all of the gaming gear included in a GAME Checkpoint space.

  - This spreadsheet may not include gear that we would recommend for your space.
  - Please contact us directly if you would like advice on what we would recommend for your accessible gaming space.

  See more information on the spreadsheet below.

    title: "What is Included"
    excerpt: |
      In this spreadsheet there are two sheets: "Centre Equipment List" and "Min Equipment List - Xbox".

      - "Centre Equipment List": This is the full list of gaming gear that was given to many of the centers. You can use this to help inform you of the various gaming gear and AT to create an accessible gaming space. Or if you are a GAME Checkpoint, you can use this to get more info on your devices.
      - "Min Equipment List Xbox": We heard from quite a few centers that currently have an Xbox One or Xbox Series X/S that are looking for a smaller list of gear they would need to start a mini accessible gaming space.
