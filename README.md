# GAME Checkpoints (Game Accessibility Made for Everyone)

This GitHub hosts all of the Makers Making Change resources that are used to launch GAME Checkpoints and a palce for current GAME Checkpoints to access the resources. There is a website created for ease of viewing/downloading the files at: https://makersmakingchange.github.io/GAME-Checkpoints/

## SUMMARY 
The GAME Checkpoints project pilot spanned from October 2022 - March 2023. We worked with clincial, education, and game development organizations to establish adaptive gaming spaces within their organization. This increased the ability for gamers to access assitive technology around gaming and test out technology relevant to them with experts while also educating the Checkpoint leads on accessibility in gaming.

## What is included in the resources?
The files contained on this page are the resources that were given to the centers. These includes 6 part booklet reference booklets, full list of materials delivered, and questionaires to work with gamers who are looking to test our various assitive technology/gaming options.
